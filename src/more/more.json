            "description": "Pokhara was historically a vital trade route connecting India and Tibet. The region was frequently used by traders and merchants who transported salt, wool, and other goods across the Himalayas. This trade route helped Pokhara grow as a commercial hub in Nepal. The earliest inhabitants of the region were the indigenous Gurung and Magar communities, who played a significant role in Nepalese history, particularly as brave warriors in the British Gurkha regiments. During the medieval period, Pokhara was under the influence of the Kaski Kingdom, one of the 24 small kingdoms (Baise Rajya) of western Nepal. The rulers of Kaski were part of the Shah dynasty, which later unified Nepal under King Prithvi Narayan Shah. Due to its fertile lands and strategic location, Pokhara remained an important settlement in Nepalese history.",

During the medieval Malla dynasty (12th–18th centuries), the valley flourished as three rival kingdoms—Kathmandu, Patan, and Bhaktapur—competed to create architectural marvels like the Durbar Squares and Swayambhunath Stupa. The 17th-century King Pratap Malla expanded trade with Tibet, while the 18th-century unification under Prithvi Narayan Shah made Kathmandu Nepal’s capital. The valley became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979, recognized for its fusion of Hindu and Buddhist traditions.",

Rediscovered in 1896 by Nepalese archaeologists and verified through ancient texts, Lumbini’s revival began in the 1960s with UNESCO-led excavations. It became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997."
